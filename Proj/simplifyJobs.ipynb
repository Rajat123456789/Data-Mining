This spawns features relevant to topics within the congestion control, load balancing, and reliability spectrum (of course, the internship topic will be focused on a subset of thoseaspects).

We have been heavily focused recently on the intersection of Large Language Model (LLM)-based tools and human cognition and productivity. Additionally, our main areas of interest are: innovating ways to make data, models, and algorithms easier for people to understand; polling and forecasting; advancing crowdsourcing methods; and understanding the market (and impact) for news and advertisement. Our approach is motivated by two longstanding difficulties for traditional social science: first, that simply gathering observational data on human activity is extremely difficult at scale and over time; and second, that running experiments to manipulate the conditions under which these measurements are made (e.g., randomly assigning large sets of interacting people to treatment and control groups) is even more challenging and often impossible.&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\\\"margin: 0px;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family: calibri, sans-serif;\\\">\\u202f&nbsp;</span></p><p style=\\\"margin: 0px;\\\"><span style=\\\"font-family: calibri, sans-serif;\\\">In the first category, we exploit digital data that is generated by existing platforms (e.g., email, web browsers, search, social media) to generate novel insights into individual and collective human behavior.

However, these tools lack the power and general flexibility of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this Research Internship, we seek to explore ways of exploring the best of both worlds.
